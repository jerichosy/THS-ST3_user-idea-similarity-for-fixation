        "\n",
        "1. **Idea Representation**:\n",
        "   We convert each subidea into a numerical representation (embedding) to capture its semantic meaning. Each subidea is treated as a point in a high-dimensional space, where semantically similar ideas are closer together.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Pairwise Comparisons**:\n",
        "   For each user, we compare consecutive subideas within the same branch. Cosine similarity is used to measure the closeness of these ideas, reflecting how similar or different they are in meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Similarity Distribution**:\n",
        "   For each user and idea, we calculate a collection of similarity scores between consecutive subideas. This distribution represents the spread of similarity among the subideas, giving insights into how ideas evolve and refine.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Statistical Summary**:\n",
        "   - **Mean Similarity**: Represents the average similarity between consecutive subideas. A higher mean suggests that ideas are generally more cohesive and focused.\n",
        "   - **Standard Deviation (std)**: Represents the variability in similarity scores. A higher std indicates more variability in how similar or different the subideas are from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparing Distributions**:\n",
        "   We interpret the mean similarities and standard deviations to understand the user's approach to idea refinement. A smaller std suggests consistent refinement, while a larger std indicates diverse refinement paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Interpretation**:\n",
        "   - Higher mean similarity indicates less diversity or variation among ideas, suggesting a focused thought process.\n",
        "   - Higher standard deviation indicates more variability, suggesting a wider exploration of ideas.\n",

        "- **Mean Similarity**: Higher mean similarity generally reflects more focused and cohesive idea development, suggesting the user followed a more structured refinement process.\n",
        "- **Standard Deviation**: Higher variability (standard deviation) indicates more diverse paths taken during the refinement process, with the user exploring different dimensions of the ideas.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusions\n",
        "1. **Individual Trends**:\n",
        "   - Users with higher mean similarities typically show focused thought processes, indicating coherent refinement of ideas.\n",
        "   - Users with higher standard deviations show a mix of focused and diverse refinements, suggesting a flexible approach to idea iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency and Divergence**:\n",
        "   - Single comparisons (std = 0) highlight consistent refinement without divergence, often seen in users with straightforward idea refinement processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Variability**:\n",
        "   - Moderate to high variability (std > 0) indicates diverse exploration paths, where users iteratively refine and explore different aspects of their ideas.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "- **Sample Size**: The number of comparisons may vary significantly among users, impacting the consistency of the results.\n",
        "- **Divergence Handling**: Not all users have divergent paths, limiting the interpretation of variability for users with linear idea refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the analysis provides insights into individual refinement processes, highlighting the balance between focused vs. diverse idea evolution. Future studies might consider equalizing sample sizes and exploring deeper refinement stages for more comprehensive insights."
